# alfred-darkmode
An Alfred workflow to toggle Dark mode and Light mode on MacOS 10.10+.

Amazingly it still holds up 4 years on when a 'true dark mode' finally came to be with MacOS 10.4 Mojave.

## Install
Download the darkmode.alfredworkflow and double-click to install.

## Usage
Open Alfred and trigger by:

* typing `darkmode`
* using Hotkey `⌃ + ⌥ + \`

Or customise as suits you!

## Version history
1.1 – qualified compatibility with 10.14. added hotkey trigger. updated icon.
